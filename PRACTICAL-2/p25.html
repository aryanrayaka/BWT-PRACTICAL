        <h2>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) (AI)</h2>
        <font face="arial" size="8" color="black">
        <p>Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is an academic subject comprising approaches of computer science and computer engineering. There is no clear division in computing between science and engineering, just like in the field of materials science and engineering. However, some classes are historically more related to computer science (e.g. data structures and algorithms), and other to computer engineering (e.g. computer architecture). CSE is also a term often used in Europe to translate the name of technical or engineering informatics academic programs. It is offered in both undergraduate as well postgraduate with specializations.
            Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) is an interdisciplinary field focused on the design, development, and maintenance of computer systems, encompassing both software (algorithms, programming, operating systems) and hardware (computer design and hardware components). The field is characterized by its broad applications, requiring strong problem-solving and coding skills for roles like software developers and data administrators, with opportunities in emerging areas such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), cybersecurity, and cloud computing.

    <h2>Information technology (IT)</h2>
    <p>Information technology (IT) is the use of computer systems, networks, software, and other digital devices to store, retrieve, process, and transmit information. IT is a broad field encompassing infrastructure, software applications, data management, and cybersecurity to support business, government, and personal operations in the digital world. It involves managing the entire flow of information, from creation and processing to storage, retrieval, and exchange.

        <h2>IT management</h2>
        <p>IT management is the process of monitoring, directing, and administering an organization's information technology systems, including hardware, software, networks, and data, to ensure they operate efficiently, effectively, and in alignment with business objectives. It involves strategic planning, budgeting, managing IT staff and projects, ensuring data security and compliance, and providing technical support to help employees perform their jobs.
            Information technology management (IT management) is the discipline whereby all of the information technology resources of a firm are managed in accordance with its needs and priorities. Managing the responsibility within a company entails many of the basic management functions, like budgeting, staffing, change management, and organizing and controlling, along with other aspects that are unique to technology, like software design, network planning, tech support etc.

    <section id="Web development">
        <h2>Web development</h2>
        <p>Web development is the process of creating, building, and maintaining websites and web applications. It involves several key components, including front-end development (user-facing elements), back-end development (server, application, and database), and full-stack development (both front and back ends). Essential skills include knowledge of languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, as well as various programming languages such as Python, Java, and PHP.
